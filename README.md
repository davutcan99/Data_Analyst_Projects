# Data Analyst Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Analyst portfolio! This repository showcases some of the data analysis projects and exercises I have worked on, demonstrating my skills in handling data, performing data cleaning, visualization, and analysis using various tools and programming languages.

## Projects

### COVID-19 Data Analysis

In this project, I utilized the COVID-19 data from "OurWorldInData" to gain meaningful insights. Here's an overview of the steps I took:

1. **Data Collection:** I gathered COVID-19 information from "OurWorldInData" in Excel format.

2. **Data Manipulation with SQL:** I performed data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) operations using SQL to obtain relevant insights and create a structured dataset.

3. **Data Cleaning:** I addressed missing values, removed duplicates, and performed data cleaning to ensure the data's accuracy and consistency.

4. **Data Visualization with Tableau:** I used Tableau to visualize the processed data, creating various charts and graphs to present the findings effectively.

### Data Analysis with Python and Pandas

In this project, I worked with Python and Jupyter Notebook to analyze data from Excel files. Here's what I did:

1. **Data Loading:** I read data from Excel files into Python using the Pandas library, which allowed me to work with data in the form of dataframes efficiently.

2. **Data Exploration:** I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data's structure, identify patterns, and gain initial insights.

3. **Data Manipulation with Pandas:** I used Pandas extensively to manipulate and transform data, enabling me to derive meaningful metrics and indicators.

4. **Data Visualization:** I visualized the analyzed data using various Python libraries, such as Matplotlib or Seaborn, to create informative plots and charts.

### Amazon Web Scraper

I also developed a web scraping project to extract data from Amazon's product page. However, it's essential to note that web scraping Amazon's website without proper authorization is against their Terms of Service and should not be done.

## Exercise Codes

Apart from the projects mentioned above, I have also included exercise codes that showcase my proficiency in different data analysis techniques and tools. These exercises cover various aspects of data analysis, such as:

- Data manipulation using Pandas
- Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing
- Data cleaning and preprocessing

Feel free to explore the exercise codes to get an idea of my problem-solving abilities and coding practices.

## Technologies Used

Throughout the portfolio, I have used the following technologies and tools:

- Python
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook
- SQL
- Tableau
- Excel

Please note that web scraping Amazon's website, as shown in the "Amazon Web Scraper" project, is against Amazon's policies and is not recommended. Always ensure that you comply with website terms of service and policies when conducting web scraping activities.
